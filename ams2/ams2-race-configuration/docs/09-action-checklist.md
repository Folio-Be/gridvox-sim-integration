## 🔄 PARALLEL TRACK: UI Automation (DO NOT BLOCK ON REIZA)

**Important:** Continue UI automation development while waiting for Reiza response!

### Week 1 (In Parallel):
- [ ] Complete coordinate calibration (CRITICAL BLOCKER)
  - Launch AMS2 on primary monitor (1920x1080)
  - Run simple-coordinate-capture.ahk
  - Capture 20-30 UI elements
  - Update ams2-race-config.ahk with coordinates
- [ ] Test single race configuration via UI automation
- [ ] Achieve >80% success rate
- [ ] Document as "Plan B"

### Week 2 (In Parallel):
- [ ] Run batch-runner.js with 5 test configs
- [ ] Refine timing and error handling
- [ ] Achieve >90% success rate
- [ ] Integrate with GridVox desktop app (if ready)

**Rationale:** UI automation is ready to go and works. Don't wait weeks for Reiza response - build both approaches in parallel.
