TITLE: [Developer Question] Race Configuration File Format - AI Voice Assistant Integration

POST TO: https://forum.reizastudios.com/
SECTION: Modding & Tools (or General Discussion)

---

Hello Reiza Team and Community! 👋

I'm developing GridVox, an AI-powered voice assistant for sim racing that allows drivers to control their simulator through natural voice commands. Think "Hey GridVox, set up a GT3 race at Spa with 24 opponents in the rain" and the system handles everything automatically.

✅ CURRENT PROGRESS WITH AMS2:
We've successfully implemented real-time telemetry integration:
• Direct shared memory access ($pcars2$) for <1ms latency
• 20+ event detection types (overtakes, incidents, pit stops, sector times, etc.)
• Live AI commentary based on race events
• Tested with 41-car race sessions (100% reliability)
• Complete TypeScript event detection library

🎯 THE NEXT CHALLENGE:
Voice-commanded race configuration is our next feature. We need to programmatically configure race sessions (track, car class, opponents, weather, time of day, session length, etc.).

🔍 WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED:
We've investigated the savegame files but hit a roadblock:

File Location:
C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Automobilista 2\savegame\<steamid>\automobilista 2\profiles\default.sav

File Analysis:
• Size: ~7.0 MB
• Format: Proprietary binary (not XML/JSON/plaintext)
• No readable strings (track names, car classes not visible)
• Changes detected when modifying race config, but structure is unclear
• Appears to include checksum/compression
• Updates immediately when race settings are changed in-game

Attempted Analysis:
✅ Text search for track names - None found (binary/compressed)
✅ Header analysis - Unknown proprietary format
✅ String extraction - No readable strings
✅ Binary diff - Changes detected at byte 17+ but structure unclear

❓ QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY & DEVELOPERS:

1. Has anyone successfully decoded this file format?
2. Is there any documentation (official or community) on the structure?
3. Would Reiza be open to sharing the file structure (even partial documentation)?
4. Are there plans for an official API for race configuration?
5. Any guidance on safe modification approaches?
6. Did pCARS2 (predecessor) use a similar format with any documentation?

🔄 OUR ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
We can use UI automation (AutoHotkey simulating menu navigation) as a fallback, but direct file access would be:
• More reliable
• Faster
• Less maintenance
• Cleaner integration

We've already built the UI automation framework and it works, but file access is the superior approach if possible.

🎁 WHY THIS BENEFITS THE AMS2 COMMUNITY:

For Players:
• Voice control accessibility for racing
• AI commentary that understands race context
• Automated race setup via voice commands
• Could attract new players to sim racing

For Reiza:
• Free marketing: GridVox will showcase AMS2 integration prominently
• Potential increased sales from AI/voice control enthusiasts
• Demonstrates AMS2's extensibility
• Community innovation showcase

We're willing to:
• Sign NDA if needed
• Beta test and provide feedback
• Share our telemetry integration code with the community (open source)
• Credit Reiza prominently in all marketing
• Collaborate on best practices

🔗 PROJECT CONTEXT:
• Technology: Node.js, TypeScript, Electron, native C++ addon
• Already working: Real-time AMS2 telemetry via shared memory
• Goal: Complete voice-controlled race weekend experience
• Target audience: Sim racers + AI enthusiasts

📊 TECHNICAL DETAILS (for modders):
If anyone wants to collaborate on reverse engineering:
• We have baseline vs. modified file samples
• Built diff analysis tools
• Can share findings and methodology
• Happy to coordinate research efforts

Has anyone in the community already tackled this problem? Any insights, partial documentation, or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for building such an amazing sim! 🏎️

Best regards,
GridVox Development Team

UPDATE (will edit this section as we learn more):
• Investigating UI automation as primary path
• Researching Madness Engine modding resources
• Open to collaboration with community modders
