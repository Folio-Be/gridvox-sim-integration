# GridVox AI Livery Designer - Research Documentation Complete

## Project Location
C:\DATA\GridVox\gridvox-sim-integration\all-sims\livery-designer

## Documentation Created (January 11, 2025)

### Core Documents (4 files, ~65KB total):
1. ✅ README.md (11KB) - Project overview, tech stack, timeline, status
2. ✅ IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md (21KB) - 6 phases, weekly tasks, success criteria
3. ✅ RESEARCH-FINDINGS.md (19KB) - 8 neural UV systems, recommendations
4. ✅ COMMERCIAL-ANALYSIS.md (24KB) - Trading Paints, RaceControl, market analysis

### Key Findings Documented:

**Best Neural UV System:** AUV-Net (NVIDIA) - tested on cars, 85-90% quality
**Backup System:** Neural Surface Maps (UCL) - fully open source
**Commercial Insight:** Trading Paints Paint Builder = 40k/year from 4/yr subscription
**Market Opportunity:** 00k ARR at 10k users (Year 1 target)
**Timeline:** 16 weeks to production launch
**Budget:** 5k development + 00 GPU training

### Recommended Approach:
✅ Direct photo → UV generation (AUV-Net style)
✅ NOT 3D intermediate (TripoSR → Three.js → UV remapping)
✅ Rationale: Faster, simpler, higher quality

### Next Steps:
1. Start Phase 1: Project setup, AUV-Net testing
2. Request NVIDIA commercial license
3. Extract AMS2 assets (3 GT4 cars)
4. Begin training data collection

All research from extensive online investigation has been preserved.
Status: ✅ Ready to begin implementation
