# Implementation Checklist: AI Livery Designer

**Project:** SimVox.ai AI-Powered Livery Generation
**Timeline:** 16 weeks to production launch
**Budget:** $45,000 development + $300 GPU training
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 Complete → Starting Phase 1

---

## Phase 0: Research & Planning ✅ COMPLETE

- [X] Research neural UV mapping systems *8 systems evaluated: AUV-Net (best), FlexPara (newest), GraphSeam (proprietary), Nuvo (unofficial), Neural Surface Maps (open), Texture-GS (real-time), ParaPoint (unreleased), AtlasNet (mature)*
- [X] Analyze commercial platforms *Trading Paints ($24/yr, Paint Builder browser editor, localhost:34034 downloader) and RaceControl Livery Hub (auto-previews, 3-click assignment, API integration) workflows documented*
- [X] Evaluate AI 3D generation tools *TripoSR (0.5s, MIT), Hunyuan3D-2 (best quality, CLIP 0.809), TRELLIS (2B params, flexible), Shap-E (older) assessed; decided against 3D intermediate approach*
- [X] Define user personas & workflows *4 personas created: Alex (amateur racer, 28yo, main), Sarah (league organizer), Marcus (content creator), Emma (pro designer); complete user journeys with time savings (20hrs → 8min)*
- [X] Design UI/UX specifications *9 screens designed: Landing, Upload, CarSelection, AIGeneration, Preview, 2DEditor, 3DEditor, Export, Library; Google AI Studio prompts created*
- [X] Assess open source availability *AUV-Net (non-commercial NVIDIA license, requires permission), Neural Surface Maps (open, UCL), Texture-GS (open, ECCV 2024), AtlasNet (open, CVPR 2018) confirmed available; GraphSeam proprietary, ParaPoint unreleased*
- [X] Document all research findings *Complete documentation in 8 files: README, IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST, RESEARCH-FINDINGS, COMMERCIAL-ANALYSIS, TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE, USER-STORIES, UI-UX-DESIGN, OPEN-SOURCE-STATUS*
- [X] **Deep research on car-specific weights** *Found DreamCar (xiaobiaodu, 15.5GB, MIT license, ONLY car-specific model), CADillac dataset (1,000+ cars, CC BY 4.0), comprehensive APPROACH-COMPARISON.md created*

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL DECISION BEFORE PHASE 2:**
**Review [APPROACH-COMPARISON.md](APPROACH-COMPARISON.md) to choose training data strategy:**
- **Option A:** DreamCar pre-trained (2 hours setup, 80-85% quality, MIT license, FASTEST)
- **Option B:** Train on CADillac (1 week, 85-90% quality, CC BY 4.0, BEST QUALITY)
- **Option C:** Blender Synthetic (24-48 hrs, 85-90% quality, NVIDIA license, ORIGINAL PLAN)
- **Option D:** Hybrid (test DreamCar, fine-tune if needed, RECOMMENDED)

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach saves 1-3 weeks, zero licensing risk, upgrade path if needed.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Risk:** NVIDIA denies commercial license for AUV-Net
  - **Mitigation:** Use Neural Surface Maps as alternative, or re-implement AUV-Net architecture from paper
- **Risk:** AI quality <75% accuracy
  - **Mitigation:** Collect more training data, fine-tune SDXL, offer manual refinement tools
- **Risk:** Inference too slow (>60s)
  - **Mitigation:** Use TensorRT optimization, quantization, or cloud GPUs

### Business Risks

- **Risk:** Low user adoption (community doesn't want AI liveries)
  - **Mitigation:** Emphasize manual editing tools, position as "assistant" not "replacement"
- **Risk:** Trading Paints copies our AI feature
  - **Mitigation:** Move fast, build strong community, differentiate on quality and multi-sim support
- **Risk:** High infrastructure costs (>$1000/month)
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize inference, use spot instances, implement queue system

### Legal Risks

- **Risk:** Copyright issues with reference photos (users upload copyrighted images)
  - **Mitigation:** Clear ToS stating users must own rights, DMCA takedown process, watermark detection
- **Risk:** Sim developers prohibit AI-generated liveries
  - **Mitigation:** Engage with Reiza (AMS2), iRacing early, emphasize community benefit, offer revenue sharing

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Direct UV Generation** (not 3D intermediate) - Faster, simpler, higher quality
2. **AUV-Net style architecture** - Proven on car datasets, aligned UV learning
3. **Blender for training data** - Automate rendering, full control over lighting/angles
4. **Tauri desktop app** - Better than Electron (smaller, faster), but also offer web version

### Key Business Decisions

1. **3-tier SaaS model** - Free (2 liveries/month), Pro ($4.99, unlimited), Creator ($14.99, marketplace)
2. **Start with AMS2** - Smaller community, easier to extract assets, more modding-friendly
3. **Marketplace revenue sharing** - 70/30 split attracts creators, builds community
4. **Phase 6 (3D editor)** - Only if Phase 5 validates strong demand

### Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

- *Week 1:* [TBD]
- *Week 5:* [TBD]
- *Week 10:* [TBD]
- *Week 15:* [TBD]
