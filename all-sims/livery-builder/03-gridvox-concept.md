## GridVox Ecosystem Integration

### Integration Point 1: Personas 🤖

**Concept:** Your GridVox personas (crew chief, coach, commentator, friends, family) can interact with you while designing liveries.

**Examples:**
- **Darth Vader (crew chief):** "This livery lacks power. Add more black and red, young designer."
- **Gordon Ramsay (coach):** "What is this? My grandmother could design a better livery! Add some bloody contrast!"
- **Your Dad:** "Son, that color scheme reminds me of your first go-kart. Make it blue like we had back then."
- **Ayrton Senna (historical):** "In my time, we kept liveries simple but iconic. Consider a bold color with minimal clutter."
- **Your Best Friend:** "Dude, that sponsor placement is wonky. Move it to the left."

**Features:**
- **Voice Commands:** "Hey [persona name], what do you think of this design?"
- **AI Suggestions:** Personas offer design advice based on their personality
- **Design Challenges:** Persona-driven challenges ("Make Deadpool proud with a chaotic livery")
- **Motivational Feedback:** Encouragement or playful roasting as you work
- **Educational:** "Tell me about this car's original livery" (historical personas)

### Integration Point 2: Stories 📖

- **"Rotate the car to show the left side"**
- **"Make the number bigger"**
- **"Add a drop shadow to that logo"**
- **"Undo that"**

- **Voice Feedback:** Persona responds with voice confirmation
- **Correction:** "No, I meant the other logo"

## Multi-Sim Support: The Game Changer

### Supported Sims (Planned)

#### Priority 1 (MVP - 3 sims)
1. **iRacing** (largest community, most active)
2. **Assetto Corsa Competizione** (popular GT racing)
3. **Automobilista 2** (realistic, growing community)

#### Priority 2 (V1.0 - +3 sims)
4. **rFactor 2** (endurance, realistic)
5. **Assetto Corsa** (modding community)
6. **Forza Motorsport** (console/PC crossover)

9. **EA Sports WRC** (rally)
10. **Wreckfest** (fun, casual)
11. **BeamNG.drive** (realistic damage, modding)

### Template Conversion System

**Problem:** Each sim has different:
- Texture layouts (UVs)
- File formats (.tga, .dds, .png)
- Resolution requirements
- Material system (spec maps, normal maps)
- Car naming conventions

**Solution:** GridVox Livery Builder's Template Converter

**How It Works:**
1. **Design Once:** Create livery on universal canvas
2. **Select Car:** Choose car from any sim
3. **Auto-Map:** AI maps design to that car's UV layout
4. **Export:** Generate sim-specific files automatically
5. **Multi-Export:** Export same design to multiple sims with one click

**Example:**
- Design a GT3 livery for McLaren 720S
- Export to:
  - iRacing: McLaren 720S GT3 (.tga + spec maps)
  - ACC: McLaren 720S GT3 Evo (.dds layered)
  - AMS2: McLaren 720S GT3 (.dds)
  - rFactor 2: McLaren 720S GT3 (.dds + spec)
- **One design, four sims, one click**

### Car Database

**Required Data:**
- Sim name
- Car name (internal and display)
- Template file (blank UV layout)
- Texture resolution
- Supported maps (diffuse, spec, normal, emissive)
- File format
- Installation path (optional, for auto-install)

**Community Contribution:**
- Users upload templates for cars
- Earn credits for templates used by others
- Validation by moderation team
- Automatic template generation (AI traces 3D model)
