*AUDI R8 LMS 2015 BLANCPAIN SPRINT SERIES TEAM WRT #1,#2,#3,#4*
------------------------------------------

Installation:

Put each folder named as "Team_WRT_2015_1",2,3 and 4 to
/content/cars/audi_r8_lms/skins folder.


If you want to make these skins work with "audi_r8_lhm" mod, you should
change the name of these two files "r8_gts_body_dif" and "r8_gts_body_map" as
"r8_lhm_body_d" and "r8_lhm_body_m". (tire and windows files too, if necessary..)

If the cars looks purple then you did something wrong.
There are a few R8 mods too, you may succses to make these skins work with them by changing
names of .dds files accordingly..

PS: Also make sure skins copied to right car mod's skin folder.
